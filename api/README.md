To install dependencies:

## Testing proposals (requires localnet network running)

To run localnet test with iota, it's required that IOTA runs in the background (localnet).

To accomplish that, you can run:

```
iota client switch --env localnet
iota-localnet start --force-regenesis --with-faucet
```
